# ProceduralCellShapeModel

## Description
The goal of this seminar is to create a procedural model of call membrane shape extracted from real-life cell data.
The cell data can be obtained from Allan Cell institute database [1], where thousands of cells are labeled and
their shape can be extracted and used for defining the membrane model parameters. Use statistical shape
modeling (e.g. [3]) to define a cell shape. The model must allow users to customize the basic cell shape
parameters while retaining the randomness of shape through model seed parameter.
